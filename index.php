                    <span class="dropcap dropcap-dark me-3">T</span>he Shri Datta Maharaj Trimurti Shakti Pith is located in Pune and is under the management of the "Anjor Foundation," registered under No. E – 5525 in Pune. The foundation was established in 2009 under the spiritual guidance of Shri Atul Samarth and his wife Smt. Supriya Atul Samarth, who are based in Pune, Maharashtra, India. This organization was created to bring about social and spiritual reforms through spiritual and religious rituals, as well as by initiating various social activities.
                    During his counseling in 2009, Shri. Atul Samarth (commonly known as AtulDada) received blessings from Shri Datta Maharaj and Shri Swami Samarth Maharaj. He has successfully provided spiritual guidance to over a lakh of spiritual devotees. It is forecasted that in a few years, a divine temple of Shri Swami Samarth Maharaj will be constructed in the Pune city in PCMC area.</p>

                    This temple will be built by common devotees who will awaken the beliefs of adherents through their kind services and financial contributions. According to Spiritual Guru and counselor Shri. AtulDada Samarth, the beliefs of the adherents who contributed to establishing this divine temple will make this place virtuous, saintly, and religious. This temple will be a place where people can seek the blessings of Bramhandnayak Shri Swami Samarth Maharaj. For more information about AtulDada, kindly visit www.shriatuldada.com.
                    This divine temple is made special by the placement of all the holy renowned avatars of Shri DattaGuru Maharaj, such as Shri Sainath Maharaj, Shri Gajanan Maharaj, and Shri Swami Samarth Maharaj. These placements were guided to Guruvarya Shri Atuldada Samarth by Shri Swami Samarth Maharaj in meditation, transforming the shrine into a divine temple. The placement of these avatars is unique, as it honors the holy saints who don’t typically have their own temples. By placing Shri Lord Dattaguru Maharaj along with its avatars, this temple stands out among all the renowned saints who are considered avatars of Shri Datta Maharaj. It is as if all the divine powers have gathered in one place.
