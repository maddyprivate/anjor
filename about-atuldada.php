                <h5>About Guruvarya Shri. AtulDada Samarth</h5>
                <p class="mt-4">Guruvarya Shri AtulDada Samarth was born into a middle-class family in Pune city in July 1976. He completed his basic education from an English missionary school and graduated in commerce. Additionally, he pursued basic Graphic Designer courses along with Quality Management (Six Sigma Black Belt). In 2006, he married Smt. Supriya Samarth, who holds an MA in Marathi Literature and an LLB (Law) from Mumbai. In 2004, Shri Guruvarya Shri AtulDada was blessed by Shri Datta Maharaj and Shree Swami Samarth Maharaj. This marked the year when Guruvarya Shri AtulDada became inclined towards spirituality, integrating it with scientific principles. He began implementing spiritual rituals in a sophisticated and scientifically explainable manner, yielding positive results. His spiritual ideas emphasized the importance of studying nature through occult science, along with other scientific fields, based on theoretical facts rather than superstitious beliefs associated with spirituality.</p>

                <p class="mt-4">Guruvarya Shri AtulDada has successfully counseled over a hundred thousand Swamijis devotees worldwide. His deep spiritual knowledge, combined with practical and factual aspects, enables him to address various consequential issues with grace, following the teachings of his Guru, Shri Swami Samarth Maharaj. Guruvarya Shri AtulDada Samarth believes that a Guru or mentor should show the path, but not necessarily walk it alongside the disciple. The Guru’s path and aim differ from that of the disciple. While the disciple’s path can align with the Guru’s, the Guru’s path will never align with the disciples in the universe.
                    Trusting in the guidance of Guru Shri Swami Samarth Maharaj, he is empowered by knowledge rather than mere dependence. Rejecting superstitious beliefs, he takes a practical approach to solve earthly issues for the devotees. Endowed with a sixth sense by his guru, Shri Guruvarya Atuldada Samarth has an extraordinary ability to foresee the past, present, and future, and to offer insightful solutions. Witness the impact of his ability through devotees' testimonials on his website at www.shriatuldada.com.
                </p>
                <p>In 2009, he foresaw the establishment of a common devotees' temple for his Gurus in the city of Pune, Maharashtra, India. He predicted that after 14 years, a divine shrine with powerful vibrations would be built. His vision came to fruition in 2020 with the construction of a temple dedicated to Mahaguru Shri Dattaguru Maharaj and his renowned Kaliyugi avatars – Shri Gajanan Maharaj, Shri Sainath Maharaj, and Shri Swami Samarth Maharaj – all placed on the same platform. With the guidance of his guru Shri Swami Samarth Maharaj, Guruvarya Shri AtulDada Samarth, along with subordinate trustees, overcame challenges such as limited funds and resources to make this vision a reality.</p>
